# GeneratorScripts
Gradle scripts written in groovy designed to generate class files from WSDL (SOAP) and XML Beans (config) files

These scripts are useful if the company you're working for happens to still be using WSDL/SOAP interfaces using Java and/or highly validated XML configuration files that force a rigid structure and order using XML.

This project is conveniently unlicensed and I have no issues with how you use this code provided you understand it comes with no warranty. I am not responsible for how these scripts are used or their successfulness; XML in general is old technology and is no longer fit for any purpose besides for maintaining legacy systems. 

Please consider using YAML or JSON for your configurations and data transport over networks.
